After having successfully logged in you can access the administration and view your unpublished drafts or create a new article. Every published articles has an `Edit` button on the top right if you are logged in. All markdown files follow a specific but simple schema and need to in`clude a basic header formatted in [YAML](http://www.yaml.de/).

After the strict header information you are free to start writing you articles using markdown. New articles already have a basic structure and all needed header fields. If you find any bugs in parsing markdown please create an issue at GitHub!
